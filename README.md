Some work on eiitp, and [an exercism solution](https://github.com/mauriciovieira/exercism-tracks/commit/58116d8d8dc0da214ace4b0618f5b217425c580c)

### 2020-04-30 day 3

I finished configuring asdf locally with [everybody is in the place](https://github.com/mauriciovieira/eiitp/commits?author=mauriciovieira&since=2020-04-30&until=2020-04-30). Then I filed a [Bug Report](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/issues/718) to asdf and proposed a [fix for it](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/issues/719).
I decided to make some security upgrades for some repositories and deployed [one of them](https://github.com/mauriciovieira/make-a-drink) to [heroku](https://mauriciovieira-make-a-drink.herokuapp.com/).

Readings:
- https://github.com/marmelab/awesome-rest that led me to https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest, a RESTful API server for any postgresql database written in Haskell.
- https://github.com/rodrigondec/drf-api-domain/blob/master/Makefile -> https://phalt.github.io/django-api-domains/

### 2020-04-29 day 2

I didn't log here in time. I was still working in ansible, trying to make [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to work. I found an [ansible role](https://github.com/markosamuli/ansible-asdf) and made it work here.

### 2020-04-28 day 1

I have been practicing rails. Since something is broken with my asdf installation, I need to work on my ansible repo [eiitp](https://github.com/mauriciovieira/eiitp).

## 2018-06-17 Initial commit

A few days ago, I read a [blog post](https://www.codingame.com/blog/100-days-of-code-challenge/) about the #100DaysOfCode challenge and decided to try it.

That means I'll have to code for 1 hour everyday until 25th of September, according to the [rules](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/rules.md):

```bash
$ python -c 'import datetime; print((datetime.datetime.today()+datetime.timedelta(100)).strftime("%F"))'
2018-09-25
```

I'll also try to take a screenshot[1] of my contributions[2], every day. Today, before creating this repository, the situation was

In my wishlist there are the following tasks:

* Remake of my [personal website](https://mauriciovieira.net), unify the blogs that I have in it.
  * Recover my oldest notes and troubleshooting and post there.
* Finish older projects like
  * Nnb Spotify wraper in ES7
  * Nnb YouTube player in ES7
  * Nnb BigFuture in Django
  * Nnb MyWonderland in Django+React
* Become fluent in React+Redux
* Become fluent in golang by working on [exercism challenges](https://github.com/mauriciovieira/exercism-tracks)
* And maybe some other digressions (like Haskell, Elm, old ideas)
