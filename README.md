## 2018-06-17 Initial commit

A few days ago, I read a [blog post](https://www.codingame.com/blog/100-days-of-code-challenge/) about the #100DaysOfCode challenge and decided to try it.

That means I'll have to code for 1 hour everyday until 25th of September, according to the [rules](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/rules.md):

```bash
$ python -c 'import datetime; print((datetime.datetime.today()+datetime.timedelta(100)).strftime("%F"))'
2018-09-25
```

I'll also try to take a screenshot[1] of my contributions[2], every day. Today, before creating this repository, the situation was

In my wishlist there are the following tasks:

* Remake of my [personal website](https://mauriciovieira.net), unify the blogs that I have in it.
  * Recover my oldest notes and troubleshooting and post there.
* Finish older projects like
  * Nnb Spotify wraper in ES7
  * Nnb YouTube player in ES7
  * Nnb BigFuture in Django
  * Nnb MyWonderland in Django+React
* Become fluent in React+Redux
* Become fluent in golang by working on [exercism challenges](https://github.com/mauriciovieira/exercism-tracks)
* And maybe some other digressions (like Haskell, Elm, old ideas)
